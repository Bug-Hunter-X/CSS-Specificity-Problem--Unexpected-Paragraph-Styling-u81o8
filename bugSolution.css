The solution addresses the issue by increasing the specificity of the selector to target only the paragraphs within the "container" div.

```css
div.container {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
div.container p {
  color: blue;
}
```
By using `div.container p`, we ensure that only paragraphs that are direct descendants of the element with the class "container" are affected.  This prevents the unintended styling of paragraphs elsewhere in the document.
